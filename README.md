## Description
My motivation for working on this work day planner is to work on re-usable code and trying to efficiently code solutions to problems.
The application serves to help organise a persons day by giving each hour to write events in.
The user can save their to do list to local storage.
I learnt a lot about dynamically creating elements on the page and having event listeners to handle events on those newly added HTML elements.


## Usage
To use the day-planner, open it up, and you will see todays date at the top.
You can plan events for that day in the calendar below the black line.
GREY blocks are times that have already occured, best not to plan for those.
The RED block is the current time.
And GREEN blocks are future times
The cycle repeats each week.
You can ADD events to these blocks by clicking on the middle of a row and typing what you need to do.
You can SAVE these events by clicking the save icon to the right of the input field.
